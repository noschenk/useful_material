Here is some material I like to use, including my onwn and other persons templates and explanations, recommendations etc. Shortly: inspiring things.

## data visualisation
Edward R. Tufte wrote a really nice book which was strongly recommended to me : "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"

We found that book on http://visualizationuniverse.com/ which seems to definitely be worth checking out!

## github blog

## How to write and publish a scientific paper - Barbara Gastel and Robert A. Day

# upload a script while hiding paths `nonpublic`
Sometimes, you would like to share a script, but within that script, you are using paths. You may like to keep those private, e.g. because it's servers addresses of you work or just because.
In such situations, I usually create a script `nonpublic`, which contains all paths. Running it will save all necessary paths to variables.
In the shared script, I then just use the variables and explain that those contain the paths to loaded files.
The person using your script will then just need to fill in the variables accordingly and is able to use your script.

# deepl translator
