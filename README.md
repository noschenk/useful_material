# useful_material
Here is some material I like to use, including my onwn and other persons templates and explanations, recommendations etc. Shortly: inspiring things.

## git
Very nice link for a git tutorial/ book. If you want to learn git, try this.
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository#Ignoring-Files

## data visualisation
Edward R. Tufte wrote a really nice book which was strongly recommended to me : "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information"

We found that book on http://visualizationuniverse.com/ which seems to definitely be worth checking out!

## github blog
https://janhove.github.io/about.html : apparently you can have a github-blog!
